# Dataset:
I used a dataset that contains 8 folders. Each of these folders contains images of specific tomato pest.

# Feature Exraction Phase:
The feature extraction stage was performed by CNN and LSTM algorithms.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing tomato pests. The recognition phase makes use of SVM, decision tree, and KNN algorithm classifires.
